This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and attempting to access the camera features on a device that doesn't have a camera, or when the camera permissions haven't been granted.  The error message might not be very explicit, leading to confusion.  The code might look something like this:
```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; // or some loading indicator
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Camera controls here */}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};
```
This code handles permission requests, but the error arises if the device lacks a camera or permission is denied despite the request.
