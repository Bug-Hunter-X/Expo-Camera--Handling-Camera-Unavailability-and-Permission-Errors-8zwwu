# Expo Camera: Handling Camera Unavailability and Permission Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with the Expo Camera API: unclear error messages when a device lacks a camera or the necessary permissions are denied.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access the camera. However, it doesn't robustly handle scenarios where the device may not have a camera or the user denies permission.  This can lead to unexpected app crashes or behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows an improved approach.  It includes comprehensive checks for both camera availability and permission status, providing more informative feedback to the user.  It gracefully handles both cases, preventing crashes and improving the user experience.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `bug.js` on a device (or emulator) without a camera, or deny camera permissions when prompted.
3. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.

## How to fix the bug

1. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a corrected approach.
2. Implement more thorough checks for camera availability and permissions.
3. Provide user-friendly messages in the UI when the camera is unavailable or permissions are denied.
